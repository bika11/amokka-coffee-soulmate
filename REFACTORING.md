# Code Refactoring Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the ongoing refactoring efforts for the Amokka Coffee codebase, which aims to improve maintainability, reduce code duplication, and ensure consistent patterns across the application.

## Progress Summary
- ✅ Created shared core library structure
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript error in edge-function-proxy-client.ts
- ✅ Consolidated MatchScore.tsx and RecommendationScore.tsx components
- ✅ Refactored EdgeFunctionProxyClient into smaller, more focused files
- ✅ Updated imports to use shared library (completed)
- ❌ Create environment-specific adapters (not started)
- ❌ Implement graceful fallbacks (not started)
- ❌ Optimize performance (not started)

## Shared Library Structure
We've created a shared core library to unify code that was previously duplicated between frontend and backend:

```
src/shared/
├── ai/
│   ├── context-builder.ts        # Unified context building for AI models
│   ├── prompt-manager.ts         # Unified prompt management system
│   ├── base-client.ts            # Base AI client implementation (to be migrated)
│   └── types.ts                  # Shared type definitions for AI functionality
│
├── coffee/
│   ├── models.ts                 # Unified coffee data models
│   └── recommendation-utils.ts   # Recommendation algorithm utilities
│
└── utils/
    ├── rate-limiter.ts           # Rate limiting functionality
    └── validation.ts             # Common validation functions
```

## Edge Function Client Refactoring
We've broken down the monolithic EdgeFunctionProxyClient into smaller, more focused modules:

```
src/services/ai-clients/
├── edge-function-proxy-client.ts        # Main facade that delegates to specific clients
└── edge-function/
    ├── base-edge-client.ts              # Base class with common functionality
    ├── openai-edge-client.ts            # OpenAI-specific implementation
    ├── gemini-edge-client.ts            # Gemini-specific implementation
    ├── error-handler.ts                 # Centralized error handling
    └── utils.ts                         # Shared utility functions
```

## Component Consolidation
As part of the refactoring, we've consolidated related components:
- ✅ Merged `MatchScore.tsx` and `RecommendationScore.tsx` into a unified component with configurable display options

## Fixed Issues
- ✅ Resolved TypeScript error in edge-function-proxy-client.ts related to incompatible string literal types
- ✅ Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms in AI clients
- ✅ Updated all imports to use the new shared library structure

## Import Migration Progress
- AI Module:
  - ✅ Types (interface definitions)
  - ✅ Context building
  - ✅ Prompt management
- Coffee Module:
  - ✅ Models
  - ✅ Recommendation utilities
- Utils Module:
  - ✅ Rate limiting
  - ✅ Validation

## Identified Redundancies to Address
1. ✅ AI Client API Calls: Similar implementation in both edge functions and client code
2. ✅ Context Building Logic: Duplicated between server and client side
3. ✅ Score Components: Consolidated MatchScore and RecommendationScore
4. ✅ Type Definitions: Multiple similar type definitions across the codebase

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Update existing code to use the shared library (completed)
2. ❌ Create environment-specific adapters for browser/server contexts
3. ❌ Standardize error handling patterns
4. ❌ Improve performance through memoization and context optimization
5. ❌ Implement consistent fallback mechanisms for AI clients

## Code Migration Strategy
1. ✅ Create shared libraries first (completed)
2. ✅ Update imports in existing code (completed)
3. ❌ Gradually replace duplicated code with imports from shared libraries
4. ❌ Add tests to ensure behavior is preserved
5. ❌ Remove deprecated code paths once all functionality is migrated

## Future Considerations
- ❌ Set up Webpack Module Federation or similar approach for code sharing
- ❌ Implement standardized error handling across frontend and backend
- ❌ Optimize AI context building to minimize token usage
