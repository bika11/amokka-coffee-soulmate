Amokka Coffee Soulmate - Action Plan
Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive plan for refactoring and improving the Amokka Coffee Soulmate project. It's designed to address existing issues, improve code quality, and guide the implementation of new features in a structured manner. This plan serves as a trackable document for managing and monitoring progress over time.

Note on Coding Guidelines
IMPORTANT: All tasks in this action plan must be implemented following the principles outlined in CODING_GUIDELINES.md. This includes adhering to:

Code style and formatting (2-space indentation, line length, etc.)
Single Responsibility Principle and keeping functions under 20-30 lines
Explicit error handling with specific error types
Comprehensive testing practices
Meaningful commit messages following the Type: Description format
Proper documentation and comments
Logging best practices
Code review requirements
I. Immediate Priorities (Fixes & Critical Refactoring)
Edge Function Deployment Issues
❌ Fix module not found error in coffee-scraper Edge Function by creating local copies of dependent files
✅ Update import paths in all Edge Functions to reference local files rather than cross-function imports (No cross-function imports found)
✅ Add comprehensive error handling in Edge Functions with proper status codes and detailed error messages 
❌ Implement standardized CORS headers across all Edge Functions for consistent browser access
Code Organization & Structure
❌ Consolidate duplicate coffee data models between lib/coffee-data.ts and shared/coffee/models.ts
❌ Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures used across the application
❌ Fix type mismatches between Edge Functions and frontend code 
❌ Standardize error handling patterns across the codebase
Critical Functionality Fixes
❌ Fix AI fallback mechanism to properly handle service unavailability
❌ Resolve race conditions in async data fetching operations
❌ Implement proper error states in UI components when data fetching fails
❌ Add input validation to all form components to prevent invalid data submission
II. Refactoring Tasks (Based on Analysis)
✅ Implement input validation for all Edge Functions to prevent unexpected data from causing errors 
❌ Refactor EdgeFunctionProxyClient to use a more maintainable design pattern
❌ Extract common logic from OpenAIEdgeClient and GeminiEdgeClient into a base class

❌ Improve logging in Edge Functions for better debugging and monitoring
❌ Optimize bulk processing in coffee-scraper to use parallelization where appropriate
❌ Centralize common Edge Function utilities into shared modules
Frontend Component Structure
❌ Decompose large components (like CoffeeRecommendationForm) into smaller, focused components
❌ Standardize props and state management across similar components
❌ Implement proper loading states for all async operations

Tracking Progress
This document should be updated regularly to track progress. When a task is completed, the checkbox should be changed from ❌ to ✅, and the commit reference should be added.

Example:

✅ Fixed module not found error in coffee-scraper Edge Function (Fix: Updated Supabase client import in coffee-scraper - commit: <commit_hash>)
Regular reviews of this action plan should be conducted to ensure it remains aligned with project goals and to adjust priorities as needed.
